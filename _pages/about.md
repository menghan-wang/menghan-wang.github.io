My research interests span sustainability, innovation, human capital, and disclosure. I am passionate about applying machine learning, textual analysis and LLMs in my research.

I graduated from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020 with a B.M. in Accounting (ACCA) and a minor in Finance. I am an ACCA affiliate, and I have passed CFA Level II and CICPA professional level.
