Welcome! I am Menghan Wang, a sixth-year PhD candidate in finance at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am on the 2025-2026 finance academic job market. My research interests span sustainability, innovation, human capital, and disclosure. I am passionate about applying machine learning, textual analysis and LLMs in my research.

Before joining the PhD program, I graduated from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020 with a B.M. in Accounting (ACCA) and a minor in Finance. I am an [ACCA](https://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en.html) affiliate, and I have passed [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfa-program) Level II and [CICPA](https://www.cicpa.org.cn/introcicpa/) professional level.
<!-- where I was admitted to the [Special Class for the Gifted Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young) at the age of 14. -->

<!-- I will share my research with you on this website! -->
