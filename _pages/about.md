<br>

I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Finance at [the University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interests span sustainability, human capital, and innovation.

I graduated from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) in 2020 with a B.M. in Accounting (ACCA) and a minor in Finance.
<!-- where I was admitted to the [Special Class for the Gifted Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Class_for_the_Gifted_Young) at the age of 14. -->

<!-- I will share my research with you on this website! -->
